* `npx create-react-app [项目文件夹名称]`: 创建项目;
```markdown
Success! Created spirit-react at /Users/ran/Desktop/spirit-react
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  **yarn start**
    Starts the development server.

  **yarn build**
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  **yarn test**
    Starts the test runner.

  **yarn eject**
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd spirit-react
  yarn start

Happy hacking!
